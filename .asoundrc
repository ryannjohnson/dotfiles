# Find your card with
#
# $ cat /proc/asound/cards
#
# To get valid ALSA card names, use aplay:
#
# $ aplay -l | awk -F \: '/,/{print $2}' | awk '{print $1}' | uniq
#
# and then create /etc/asound.conf with following:
#
# pcm.!default {
#     type hw
#     card 1
# }
#
# ctl.!default {
#     type hw
#     card 1
# }
#
# Replace "card 1" with the number or name of your card determined above.
#
# Alternatively, you can change ordering of your cards so your USB card
# will be card 0 and it will work without editing asound.conf.
